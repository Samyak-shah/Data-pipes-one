<p> This graph was made to see if there is any trend in the density of bars by people and the number of fatal car accidents for every state. I would have expected either a positive or negative relationship. I got neither. My original idea ws to map bars on google maps (bar density by geograpgy) and get data about local car accidents and see if there is any pattern. But that kind of data was difficult to find so I had to drop the idea and settle for more course grained analysis. </p>

<p> This last trend was plottred just to see if beer consumption per capita by state has any (unconscious) effect on car insurance policy premiums. And clearly the answer is no. </p>
